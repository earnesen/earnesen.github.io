title: Research
description: My research centers on the impact of policy initiatives on education, focusing on both the teacher labor market and student educational outcomes. I investigate how these policies influence teacher retention, mobility, and training, as well as their broader implications for student success and educational equity. Additionally, I study the negative externalities generated by the legalization of sports betting, exploring how this policy change affects societal outcomes, including potential increases in intimate partner violence. Through this work, I aim to contribute to more informed and equitable policy decisions in education and related fields.
