title: Teaching
description: As a graduate student, I have developed a broad teaching portfolio, instructing courses across in-person, online synchronous, and online asynchronous formats. My experience includes teaching classes with enrollments ranging from 19 to 106 students. I prioritize creating a welcoming and inclusive classroom atmosphere where students feel comfortable engaging with the material and each other. My teaching approach emphasizes not only academic success but also the practical application of classroom concepts to real-world situations, equipping students with the skills and confidence to apply their knowledge beyond the classroom.

Selected Student Comments
  - "Having this be a repeat class for me, the projects and assignments have been more relevant than when I have taken this class before. The use of Smartwork as homework is very helpful using what I have learned in the lectures in a practical questions, which also makes the exam less daunting. I also really enjoy the use of Inquizative because it allows me to engage with the information within the textbook rather than just reading it. I think that the combinations of assignments and projects within this course really have been the most helpful in being successful in this course." - EC 202 Winter 2024
  - "Emily always reminds us that we can easily and e ectively communicate with her via o ce hours or email. We also do mandatory check-in surveys so she can better assess how we are doing. Emily's communication has set her apart from many other professors." - EC 202 Fall 2023
  - "Emily goes the extra mile with both canvas and email communication about clarification and points opportunities. This is incredibly helpful considering it is an online class. Her feedback is constructive and always conveys a genuinely supportive tone towards her students." - EC 202 Winter 2024
  - "Emily was always there to explain or help whenever I need clarification. Which ultimately is what saved me in this course because of the challenge of it." - EC 350 Winter 2023
  - "It was super helpful that Emily gave me more resources to look at when I was struggling. That was super helpful and I really appreciated it!!" - EC 202 Lab Winter 2021
  - "Going through actual practice questions really helped me understand some of the content we normally go over in the week. Those questions gave me some context and real-world applications which definitely helped me." - EC 201 Lab Fall 2020
  - "I watched the lab videos and always thought they were taught very well and explained the concepts well. Instructor Arnesen was always available to answer any questions but it was always well explained from the videos" - EC 320 Lab Fall 2022
